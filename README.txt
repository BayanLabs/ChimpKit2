ChimpKit2 is a simple API wrapper for MailChimp's API version 1.3.

There's sample code in the AppDelegate showing how to call API methods (including listSubscribe).

There's also sample code in ChimpKit2ViewController that shows how to use SubscribeAlertView, a dialog
that makes it easier to subscribe users to your mailing list.

TODO:
- Support localization
- Delegate protocol
- Improve interface (not UI) for subscribe dialog
